  \begin{abstract}
    This course introduces some useful programming techniques in C that
    are applied to build a library of reusable data structures.

    Code testing and benchmarking are expected to be two important parts
    of your work.

    This document has been designed to fill the gap between C you wrote
    when you were a child (last week), and C as it is written by the
    adults in the room.

    \textit{Note on LLMs}: Use them to understand code, not to write it
    for you. Use them also to help you when reading the references in
    the bibliography---in any case, these references and the material in
    this document set the bar of the expected technical depth of your
    report. The deepest your technical understanding of what you are
    doing, the best you will be able to make out of LLMs: toddlers and
    grown-ups rarely ask the same questions and at best they only obtain
    answers they may understand.
